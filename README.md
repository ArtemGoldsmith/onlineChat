## Node.js
To start node server you can write ``node server.js``
But you can watch your server changes with **nodemon**, so you can just write:
```$xslt
nodemon server.js
```
## Angular
In this app we are using **dist** folder as view part so you can use ``ng build``
But you can also watch your files in dist folder, so to make it all working just use:
```$xslt
ng build --watch
```
